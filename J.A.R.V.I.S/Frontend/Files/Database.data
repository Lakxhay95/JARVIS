J.A.R.V.I.S : The Mahabharata! It's one of the most epic tales in Hindu mythology. The Mahabharata is an ancient Indian epic poem that tells the story of the Pandavas and the Kauravas, two groups of cousins who engage in a great war. The story revolves around the struggle for the throne of Hastinapura, the kingdom ruled by the Kuru clan. The Pandavas, led by Yudhishthira, are the heroes of the story, while the Kauravas, led by Duryodhana, are the villains. The epic poem explores themes of duty, honor, and morality, and features many legendary characters, including Lord Krishna, who serves as a mentor and guide to the Pandavas.
Lakshay : Ramayan ke bare mein batao.
J.A.R.V.I.S : The Ramayana! It's another iconic epic tale in Hindu mythology. The Ramayana tells the story of Rama, a prince of Ayodhya, who is exiled to the forest for 14 years. During his exile, Rama's wife Sita is kidnapped by the demon king Ravana, who rules over Lanka. Rama, along with his brother Lakshmana and the monkey god Hanuman, embarks on a quest to rescue Sita and defeat Ravana. The story is a testament to Rama's bravery, loyalty, and devotion to duty, as well as the power of friendship and loyalty.
